		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuXq-k__9lQ">Link</a><br/>
		Held from your right. Your right knee against opponents hip<br/>
		to stop them mounting. Get your right hand in between their <br/>
		arm and knee. Can turn to the side to get it in. <br/>
		Use your left foot on the floor to shrimp away<br/>
		and gradually bring your right knee in to touch your elbow.<br/>
		Then put left foot on your right foot and turn to be face on<br/>
		to your opponent. Get inside hand on the hand which is controlling<br/>
		your head. <br/>
		Secret to getting out of pins is to move from<br/>
		perpendicular spines to having spines aligned. <br/>

	to prevent your hand getting attacked.
