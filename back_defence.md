<summary>Escaping back when opponent has dragged you to their strong side</summary>

Start by controlling the choking arm \
Your left hand goes thumb down from an upwards direction. Your right hand grabs near their tricep. Pull down \
\
Option 1 \
If opponent has dragged you onto their strong side, \
can bridge into opponent and fall to the other side, and then do escape above from their weak side \
\
Option 2 \
If opponent defends the bridge by putting pressure forward, \
use opponents momentum by going onto your knees and rolling them to the other side. \
Make sure you keep momentum and don't let opponent take your back when you are flat. \
\
Option 3 \
If opponents grip is not too tight, pull down their arm a little to make some room. \
Bring your weight down and slide your head out of opponents arm. \
A tip is to slide your head out going near opponents armpit. \
Bring opponents arm over your left shoulder. \
Use your right hand to push opponents arm towards them. \
This stops them from taking mount. \
Slide your left elbow to the floor. \
Keep your left elbow and head on the floor. \
Bridge and turn your legs onto your knees. Once you are on your knees, then turn your upper body and take the top position. \
Don't try to take top position with your upper body until you have turned onto your knees. \
\
Option 4 \
If opponents grip around your neck is too tight to slide your head out. \
Grab high up opponents tricep with your right hand. Left hand grabs even deeper above your right hand like seoi nage. \
Opponent will be trying to slide their elbow back to choke you, so you need to pull their arm to stop this happening. \
Go onto your knees to your left towards opponent as you pull with your arms. This is like doing a seoi nage. \
Keep pressure to stop opponent taking your back again. \
When you have some room, bring your right elbow in front of opponents body \
to block them from coming ontop and then wrap your right arm across opponents body and onto their far waist.
