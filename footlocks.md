<summary>Single leg X Guard</summary>

Opponent is standing. You are on the floor. \
Both feet between opponents legs. Left shin against opponents right leg. \
Left hand wraps around opponents leg deeply and press towards your chest. \
Right hand needs to control opponents left knee. \
Fall onto your right side. Both feet kick between opponents legs. \
Raise your hips above opponents knee. \
Left foot goes around and onto opponents right hip. Right knee clamp. \
2 takedowns: \
1) grab opponents left and right feet. Lift hips and pressure forwards. \
2) Can't reach opponents far leg. So raise hips very high and \
put pressure with your legs to the side. \

If applying X Guard correctly, opponent should be off balanced and uncomfortable. \
