<summary>Basic entry Drill</summary>

You and opponent are sitting down infront of each other with your legs out. 
Your right leg is between opponents legs. 
Left leg grapevines opponents right thigh like in de la riva. 
Left hand grabs their right heel under your left leg, also like in de la riva. 
Right foot pushes on their left thigh. Right hand grabs their belt across on their right hip side. 
Pull with your arm to go onto your left shoulder. Then keeping hips in the air, switch onto your right shoulder. 
Your right knee needs to be deep across opponents belly, must not be shallow. 
Your left leg then puts pressure forward behind opponents right knee. 
Option 1)
Keep your right hand gripping on opponents belt. Use your left hand to push opponents left leg towards their head,
 like you are stacking them. Once you have created the space, you can grab their belt on their other side hip using your left hand.
Then push only with your left leg to stretch out opponent and pull with arms. Cup opponents arm to bring them close,
 then get seatbelt and take the back.
Option 2) 
Opponent is sitting forward and their left leg is too heavy to move into stack position.
 Let go of your right hand grip on their belt and switch it to their hip on the other side. 
 Bring your head close to opponents right hip. Then should have angle to bring opponents legs back and finish like in option 1)
